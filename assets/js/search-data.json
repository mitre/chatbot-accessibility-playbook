What accessibility barriers have they encountered? Build a list of features or functions that need to be accessible.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      How will users access this chatbot, and what accessibility challenges might come with that interface?          There are a variety of platforms where users might interact with a chatbot. Each type has benefits and drawbacks with respect to accessibility. Web chatbots are hosted on a web page, which may be viewed from a smartphone, computer, or tablet. Phone text chatbots are engaged via text message only on a user’s preferred device and messaging app. App-based chatbots are offered through third-party messaging platforms like social media (e.g., Facebook) or messaging apps (e.g., Whatsapp). Voice assistant applications are interactions through third-party voice assistants (e.g., Amazon’s Alexa) that connect the user with a set of services or information.      Tip      Identify your prioritized user group(s) that the chatbot will support.        Define the finite set of tasks that the chatbot is going to support.

Profile images are a way to establish rapport with the user, but they should indicate the non-human nature of the bot. In addition, users with screen readers may not be able to see the profile picture; the chatbot needs to indicate that it is not a human in multiple ways. The chatbot should always announce itself as not human, and the word chatbot should appear prominently in the interface.      Examples      “Hi, I’m [name], a computer-based assistant for [task]”        “This is [name], an automated support system”        “Hello, my name is [name]!

After initial launch of the chatbot, collect data on response frequency and change the order if needed.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementTip      When conveying a lot of information, start with a “bottom line up-front” approach of summarizing the key information in one sentence, then use the next few sentences to add more critical details, then provide the broadest necessary context after that.        If the most important information or common choice is first, allow the user to “interrupt” the list by selecting that option, as with an automated phone menu  Examples      Start with the core information: “You’ll have your tax return in three weeks.”        Offer evidence that backs up or supports the core information: “Your forms were received on date, and you requested direct deposit to the checking account ending in 1357.”        Share context to help the user understand how accurate the information is: “Tax return times are not guaranteed, but current turnaround times are 2-3 weeks for simple tax returns with no errors.”        Give the user steps to take, if needed: “If you believe your tax return is late, contact this phone number or this email”  Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check  Is the most common answer first or last?Testing  Record each user’s choice for a question.

Choosing between many options not only requires time to evaluate each option, but also deters the decision-maker from making any decision at all.User Research  Hold a user feedback session to evaluate and refine the options that a chatbot offers. Do users struggle to decide between two options? Is an option picked infrequently? What do users select if the option they need isn’t present?Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementExamples      Offer clearly distinct choices: “Do you want to file a claim, check on an existing claim, or something else?”        Offer a limited number of choices: “Would you like to file jointly or separately?”        Offering too many choices: “Do you want to file a claim, delete an existing claim, update the information on an existing claim, view the status of an existing claim, speak to customer service,…”        Offering choices that are difficult to choose between: “Do you want to view the status of an existing claim or track an existing claim?”  Antipattern      If the chatbot offers more than 3 choices for a response, you may have too many. Examine the list of choices to see if you can remove some options, combine similar options, or point to a longer list of options on a web page.        If the choices are offered as buttons, don’t make the user scroll to read them all (with a mouse or a screen reader). If the choices don’t fit on one chatbot screen, there may be too many.

Ask members of the target user group to sort chatbot capabilities into “critical”, “useful”, and “other”. Do the commands use language the users understand?Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      Will your chatbot support free text inputs?          Free text allows more natural conversational styles and lets the user approach the task in an intuitive way. If you offer a free text input, you will need to let the user know what they can ask the chatbot. If you don’t offer a free text input, disable the text input box so users know they have to select one of the offered choices to each question.      Tip  If the list of acceptable commands changes throughout the conversation, make sure your supporting documentation (or the “help” option) updates accordingly.Examples      List 2-4 high-level commands with a list of related sub-tasks underneath: “File a claim (create a new small business or individual claim), View an existing claim (edit, close, or check the status of the claim), or Learn about claims (learn about types of claims supported by this office, determine your eligibility, and read about reimbursement methods)”        Propose 2-3 of the most common tasks and offer more if the user needs them: “You can file a claim or look up an existing claim.

Of special interest are the recommendations included in this playbook that do not correspond with existing WCAG or COGA standards. These recommendations are ripe for future research and definition.

Future research can clarify how lack of messaging or different kinds of messaging of the bot’s nature affect users with different kinds of disabilities.      Tip  When WCAG isn’t clear about chatbot features, go to users instead.Examples  When keeping the content simple (4.2.5), refer to WCAG Criterion 3.1.5 for assessing the content’s reading level as well as COGA Design Pattern 4.4.1 for making sure words are clear.Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check      Did you review WCAG as you completed the Gather and Organize phase?

Is the task content innately distressing, like death or debt? Observe people completing the task with human representatives. Do the representatives exhibit emotional intelligence when working with users? Ask the representatives about how they recognize emotional distress and how they change the task process or communication style in response to detected distress.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      Could you detect the user’s emotional language to prompt a transfer to a human representative?          Some users may get frustrated if they cannot complete the task with the chatbot, regardless of the chatbot’s success rate with the task. If you have human representatives available, they may be better suited to working with users who are getting frustrated with the chatbot. Users who are frustrated may change their communication style to reflect their emotional state.      Examples      If I’m having trouble navigating a phone system, I want the system to recognize my confusion and suggest an alternative, like speaking directly with a human operator. I don’t want the system to calmly send me in circles.        If the details of my task are upsetting (e.g., unusually high fees owed, anything to do with death), I want the chatbot to offer the option to talk to a human.

Friction slows down a task, which may be intentional (e.g., “are you sure you want to delete?”) or unintentional (e.g., “Place Order”, “Submit”, and “Confirm” steps). Friction can be useful, especially for steps that are error-prone or irreversible. On the other hand, asking users to review, re-type, or confirm multiple times may be frustrating.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      Should your chatbot include additional messages for user engagement?          Balance the need to build rapport with the need to finish the task efficiently. If the chatbot needs to improve the user’s mood or gain the user’s trust to accomplish its purpose, additional messages such as jokes or smalltalk may be appropriate.            Should your chatbot include additional steps so the user can correct mistakes?          Reduce friction except when offering a chance to correct mistakes. When asking the user to input information, it can be appropriate to include a step to ask for confirmation. Consider how users will be able to review and change their responses.      Examples      Ask for multiple pieces of information at once, like the user’s entire address.        Ask the user to confirm everything at once instead of confirming each entry.

Once a conversation pattern is designed, test is with users in a simple mockup. Can the user finish the task intuitively?

Alternatively, talk to government employees who may have a finger on the pulse of public knowledge.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      How will the user find more information on complex topics?          Including explanations for every topic will inflate content. Tooltips can be a way to provide explanations only when needed (but make sure they are accessible). Another option is to include a link to more information. Consider allowing the user to adjust the level of detail in the chatbot’s messages.      Tip      Always explain why the chatbot is asking for a response or information from the user if it is not obvious.        Add context to questions so they make sense on their own        Explain complex concepts and difficult words if those concepts and words are critical to the task.

Be sure to bring the conversation back to the original topic after explaining.

Bigger is usually better, at least when it comes to the chatbot window and the individual elements, like buttons, within the window. Buttons should especially be big enough for use on a touch screen if that is a way users might interact with the chatbot. However, the chatbot window may be too large if it obscures important content on the website when viewed on a desktop or laptop screen. If the user can resize the chatbot, make sure that any buttons for minimizing and maximizing use familiar icons.      Tip  Consider enabling users to change chatbot window size as they need, for example, to customize the chatbot window size or to make it fill the browser window. Follow OS interaction paradigms for controls to maximizing and minimizing chatbot window size.Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check  At 100% magnification, each chatbot message fits within the chatbot window.Ask the User      Is the amount of scrolling you need to do acceptable?

Learn about the communication styles of the target user groups. What vocabulary to do users employ? How do the current customer service representatives communicate policy and information to users?  Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      How will you support users when the chatbot fails to understand them?          Natural language processing isn’t as powerful as human understanding of language, so sooner or later the chatbot will encounter communication it can’t understand. You will need to offer users a way to seek help if they are unable to complete their task with the chatbot. Live communication with human representatives is ideal but may not be affordable. Alternatives include e-mail communication, an FAQ page, or a phone number and schedule of hours when phone communication is available.      Tip      If the user is asked to input data, let the user know if specific input formatting is required, or not.        If the chatbot is unable to understand the user’s messages, it should offer the user response options to proceed or offer to transfer the user to a human representative.  Examples      Typos or misspellings        Colloquial language, for example, “wages”, “income”, “money”, “pay”, or “profit”        Limited English skills        Shaky or broken speech with a speech-to-text input device  Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check      Errors due to typos or flawed speech-to-text are infrequent and the chatbot recovers gracefully.        Chatbot understands communication at a lower secondary education English proficiency.        When the chatbot doesn’t understand the user input, it offers choices to continue the conversation or it transfers the user to a human representative.  Ask the User      Does the chatbot allow you to communicate with your preferred word choice?          This question could be subjective or objective. This question should be asked post-study.            Does the chatbot understand your messages when they contain typos, English mistakes, or flawed speech-to-text?          This question could be subjective or objective. This question can be asked mid-study or post-study.            Did the chatbot’s input suggestions make sense?  References2, 11, 23, 28",

Sliders or other continuously variable inputs allow the user to select an interface characteristic from a range. This gives the user many choices but requires more development and testing effort to make sure that each potential selection is legible and meets design standards. For example, a user might be free to choose a font size between 8 and 32, which means the Developer and Tester must check the user experience with each size in that range. Toggles or other discrete inputs allow the user to select one of a handful of options. With fewer choices, it’s important that each choice is rigorously tested for legibility. What’s more, the choices need to be carefully chosen to offer an accessible experience to the greatest variety of users. For example, if users can select one of three color palettes, it’s important that at least one of the color palettes is accessible to each version of color-blindness.      Examples      Audio volume        Speech rate (if text-to-speech is available)        Color palette        Font        Font size        Chatbot size  Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check      Can the user adjust the volume of the chatbot audio outputs?

Conversely, people with cognitive or learning disabilities may not be able to read text or listen to speech as quickly as people without those disabilities.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      Will you break a long chatbot message into several shorter messages?          Sometimes it is necessary to deliver a long message, but a “wall of text” can be overwhelming and awkward for the user to navigate. An alternative is to deliver several shorter messages in a row, which raises questions about how should these messages should be paced. Digital content should not change unexpectly. Ideally, the user can anticipate and control when new content appears.      Tip  When multiple messages are necessary, allow a reasonable reading pause but indicate that there is more text coming with a typing indicator.Examples      Wait for a response from the user        Re-prompt only after a long timeout, perhaps by re-phrasing the question.

Built-in speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality can be trained for the unique words or acronyms in your application and ensures that your content is communicated exactly how you would like. It also supports situationally disabled users (e.g., a user driving a car is temporarily unable to view the screen) who may not have assistive technology available. On the other hand, users with assistive technology have (ostensibly) configured to their devices to needs and preferences. In addition, users’ devices are their own responsibility (and cost) to update as technology advances.      Tip  If your chatbot offers built-in text-to-speech, make sure the user knows how to easily turn this feature on and off.Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check      The chatbot either supports speech-to-text or behaves equivalently when a third-party speech-to-text device or software is used as an input.

Your chatbot should support font size up to 200% of the standard font size. Screen magnification increases the scale of all visual content, centered at the center of the magnified window. Your chatbot should support magnification up to 200%.        Screen magnifiers are available as apps for smart phones and computers or as features within apps (e.g., Google Chrome offers a zoom feature).

Users with low vision may benefit from high contrast, while users with cognitive or attention disabilities may prefer interfaces with less stimulating contrast. Offering multiple color palettes may require additional development. Work with a diverse set of target users to determine an appropriate color palette for your chatbot. Pay close attention to the non-neutral colors in the website’s color palette - black, white, and grey are well-researched, but a specific purple may not be. View the colors on a range of user devices, as colors are rendered differently on different screens.Phase 2: Design &amp;amp; ImplementDesign Question      How will you let the user change the color palette?          Customizable color palettes serve the widest range of users. You could allow users to adjust the colors of various interface elements independently, but a small carefully chosen set of palettes can serve a wide range of users while conforming to your organization’s design standards.      Tip      The color palette should include sufficient contrast between elements and their borders or the background.        Use an automated checker to identify color contrast that does not meet WCAG success criteria        Use a palette checker to assess contrast within your chosen color palette.        Whether or not the content is relevant to the purpose of the chatbot, the color palette must make the same content visible to all users.  Antipattern  Color should not be the only method of differentiating objects on the screen. Use additional methods like position and labels to distinguish objects.Phase 3: Test &amp;amp; EvaluateSelf Check      The colors of my chatbot interface adhere to WCAG color contrast guidelines.

Bigger is usually better. This applies to all forms of text, including button labels, images of text, and the size of icons. However, text may be too large if it causes messages to be too long to read without scrolling.            Will you dedicate the resources toward native zoom and magnification, or will you focus that effort toward testing with third-party tools?          Most web browsers and computers allow the user to resize the content font. However, you will not have complete control over how the UI looks when enlarged. Offering a capability to zoom or enlarge the text within the chatbot will give you greater control over the appearance of the chatbot.            How will you let users adjust the font size?          Offer a customizable font size to serve the widest range of users. Sliders or numerical inputs let users choose from a range of sizes, whereas a finite set of sizes (e.g., 100%, 150%, 200%) serves a wide range of users while allowing the designer to control the look of the chatbot.      Tip      Number or bullet next steps so that they are concise and easy to interpret. Prioritize the steps in order of importance, most important being first.

This helps the user start the conversation afresh if they have not been able to accomplish their task or if they want to complete a new task. Simply leaving a website or app may not restart the conversation, since the chatbot application may use cookies to remember a visiting device.User Research  Are users typically completing the task while doing other things like seeking out documentation?

Be prepared to provide the answers to these questions to the team members who will make design decisions for the chatbot.            ID      Recommendation      Research Task      Check                  1      4.1.1 Recognize  platform  needs      Ask users about their past experiences completing the tasks that the chatbot is intended to support. What accessibility barriers have they encountered? Build a list of features or functions that need to be accessible.                    2      4.1.2 Accessibility  certifications      Ask development teams of other chatbots in the same domain (e.g., government services) what chatbot platform they used and what accessibility testing they have performed.                    3      4.1.3 Choose an  accessible  platform      Ask users about accessible chatbots they have interacted with, especially in the same domain (e.g., government services). Try to contact those developers and ask about the platform and tools they used.                    4      4.2.3 Use  emotional  intelligence      Learn about the user’s emotional state while completing this task. Is the task content innately distressing, like death or debt? Observe people completing the task with human representatives. Do the representatives exhibit emotional intelligence when working with users? Ask the representatives about how they recognize emotional distress and how they change the task process or communication style in response to detected distress.                    5      4.2.5 Use  simple  messages      Determine the language level of your users. Does the intended demographic skew young or old, have a relatively high or low educational attainment, or tend to speak English as a second language? Review the task language with users. Which words are most commonly not understood?                    6      4.2.7 Build  simple  conversations      How do users prefer to complete the task or tasks that the chatbot is going to support? Ask users to break the task down into 3-5 steps. If a step is complex, ask them to break it down again into 3-5 sub-steps. Look for patterns across users. Once a conversation pattern is designed, test is with users in a simple mockup. Can the user finish the task intuitively? Where do they get stuck?                    7      4.2.8 Clarify  complex  topics      List out the topics that the chatbot is supporting. Ask users whether they think the topic is cconfusing or unclear. Ask objective questions (i.e., questions with correct answers) about the topics to learn about average knowledge. Alternatively, talk to government employees who may have a finger on the pulse of public knowledge.                    8      4.2.13 Highlight important info      Determine the most common answer(s) to a question. Is there data from the current way of accomplishing this task in a database that you can query? Can the customer service representatives that perform this task offer insights on common responses to the question? Ask users to rank the most common or important answer in a set. After initial launch of the chatbot, collect data on response frequency and change the order if needed.                    9      4.2.14 Limit  choices      Hold a user feedback session to evaluate and refine the options that a chatbot offers. Do users struggle to decide between two options? Is an option picked infrequently? What do users select if the option they need isn’t present?                    10      4.2.15 List commands      Learn about the essential workflows that users want to follow and design the list of commands to support that.  Ask members of the target user group to sort chatbot capabilities into “critical”, “useful”, and “other”. Do the commands use language the users understand?                    11      4.2.16 Set  expectations      What do users expect to happen after the conversation? What language communicates these next steps accurately? Do users have the information and resources to complete next steps?                    12      4.2.17 Communicate  privacy policies      Work with policy experts and users to understand what data must be saved to complete the task, what privacy policies protect that data, and what degree of privacy users would expect with the data.                    13      4.2.18 Recognize  errors      Observe users completing this task in person. What phrasing do they use? Do the users understand the way the chatbot communicates, evewn if it doesn’t match the way they communicate?                    14      4.2.19 Reduce  panic  triggers      Ask users to describe how they feel about the topic that the chatbot is intended to address. Take note of the emotions the users mention and the specific part of the task that prompts the emotional response. You may discover something about the process in general that could be improved, with or without a chatbot!                    15      4.3.6 Offer  color contrast      It’s difficult to select one color contrast that works well for all users. Users with low vision may benefit from high contrast, while users with cognitive or attention disabilities may prefer interfaces with less stimulating contrast. Offering multiple color palettes may require additional development. Work with a diverse set of target users to determine an appropriate color palette for your chatbot. Pay close attention to the non-neutral colors in the website’s color palette - black, white, and grey are well-researched, but a specific purple may not be. View the colors on a range of user devices, as colors are rendered differently on different screens.                    16      4.3.14 Accept varied language      If you have access to historical user data like forms, see if there are any common typos, mis-spellings, or other mistakes.                    17      4.3.14 Accept varied language      Learn about the communication styles of the target user groups. What vocabulary to do users employ? How do the current customer service representatives communicate policy and information to users?                    18      4.4.2 Make user aware of the chatbot      Find out where your users would look for a chatbot on your website so that you can provide access to the chatbot where they expect it. Ask them where the activation button should be and if they would look for a skip link or help menu to navigate to the chatbot. Does the user go directly to the “Search” function in their browser to look for the chatbot?                    19      4.4.5 Consider accessibility in transitions      Find out what human resources are available and the gaps in accessibility to these resources. If possible, make the transition to these existing resources as seamless as possible. If there is not an accessible human resource, consider addressing that unmet need.                    20      4.4.6 Time out gracefully      Are users typically completing the task while doing other things like seeking out documentation? Does the task take a long time, which might require multiple phases of effort? How long does the task take when a user is completely focused? How long does it take when distracted?                    21      4.5.3 Test with devices      Ask users what types of devices and browsers they use to access web content. Be sure to pay attention to software versions. Ask the user how familiar they are with the device.                    22      4.5.5 Include diverse users      Who is your target population?
